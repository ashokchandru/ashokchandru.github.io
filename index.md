## _Welcome to my GitHub page!_
_Welcome to my profile! I’m passionate about technical documentation, artificial intelligence, and open-source technologies, especially where they intersect to create smarter, more efficient ways to share knowledge._

_As an expert in Technical Writing, I bring a strong background across enterprise, networking, cybersecurity, and financial software domains. I focus on delivering clear, consistent, and high-impact content — from developer and API documentation to product manuals, release notes and knowledge base resources — that supports both developers and endusers._

_Throughout my career at Oracle, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), SonicWall, and Symantec, I’ve contributed to projects that required close collaboration with engineering, product management groups, and support teams. I take pride in leading documentation efforts that align with Agile and DevOps practices, ensuring timely, accurate, and scalable results._

_I spent the past decade working in a broad range of authoring and content management tools, including MadCap Flare, Adobe FrameMaker, SDL (RWS Tridion), Vasont, Oxygen XML Editor,and XMetaL. I have working knowledge in Postman and Swagger for API documentation and testing, as well as collaboration platforms such as Confluence, Jira, GitLab, and GitHub. Python and JavaScript are my favorite programming languages!_

_I enjoy mentoring junior writers, optimizing documentation workflows, and driving quality improvements based on user feedback and metrics. I’m always interested in opportunities where clear communication, technology, and leadership come together to make a difference._
